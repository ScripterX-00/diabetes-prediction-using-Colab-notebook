## diabetes-prediction

# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on key medical attributes using Machine Learning algorithms. The system is trained on a dataset containing health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and more.

# 🎯 Objectives

- Build a Machine Learning model to predict diabetes.
- Perform data preprocessing and feature analysis.
- Train and evaluate multiple ML algorithms.

# ⚙️ Workflow

- Data Loading
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Selection
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation

# 🧪 Machine Learning Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# 📊 Accuracy
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) :- 73%
- Logistic Regression :-73%
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) :-81%
- Gaussian Naive Bayes :-73%


# 🏆 Best Performing Model

Among all the tested models, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) achieved the highest accuracy of 81%, and was selected as the final model for diabetes prediction.
